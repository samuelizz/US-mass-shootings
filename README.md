# US-mass-shootings
I built a simple yet interactive dashboard using this [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hemil26/mass-shootings-in-united-states-20182022). Being someone who is not United States based, I was very eager to explore the data to see some insights. After building the simple interactive dashboard, I got to see some insights which I did not initially think of.

####  Some of the insights;
* Texas has the highest number of deaths within 2018 - 2022
* Most incidents occur during the 2nd and 3rd quarter of the year.
* The death rate per incident during the period was about 20.5%.
* Most incidents also occur on weekend which actually makes sense
